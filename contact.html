			<h4 class= "text-center"> AND A FEW DETAILS ON THE DESIGNER TURNED DEVELOPER BIT...</h4>
			<p class="text-center">I have a BS in Interior Architecture and worked in the commercial design world for a few years before leaving to teach at Kent State University. During that time I also worked at my families Durable Medical Equipment company starting out in Medicare Audits with a self-set goal of "working myself out of a job"... About a year later I had worked with every department to make our paperwork and documentation processes the most streamlined they could be. A few dozen custom forms later and a change-up in internal processes we were no longer duplicating work and our billing department was getting the documentation they needed. Our audits went from a full time position to a few hours a week and I needed a new job. </p> 
	
			<p class="text-center">This idea of looking at a problems from new angles followed me to other positions within the company and knowing that I did not want to take over the family
				  business I starting exploring other ways to bring my love of efficiency and organization to meet my creative side.</p>     
			  
			<p class="text-center">Web-development seemed like a perfect fit and the more I read and tried my hand at coding the more I loved it. I made the decision to quit my job and enroll in a coding bootcamp and 
				can honestly say it has been one of the best decisions I could have made. Everyday I am excited to learn something new, share a new found solution or find time to talk to the incredibly
				 talented and intellegent people I call my classmates and teachers.</p>      
			
			<p class="text-center">When I'm not at my computer you can probably find me enjoying time with my friends and family, playing volleyball or possibly exploring a National Park.</p>
